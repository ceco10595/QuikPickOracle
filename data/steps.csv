2_2,1,How should I start troubleshooting this error?,"Check if the cooler shopping cart is present in the CCR. If the CCR is stuck in the shopping cart, reboot the cooler by press the GFCIs RESET button, unplugging and re-plugging the mains cord, then opening the Service UI ? Reboot dialog."
2_2,2,It is still not working.,Thank you for your patience. Please contact the QuikPick team. You will need a photo of the Service UI BasicInfo section and the Jupiter PCSN. Ensure you mention the error code to the team.
2_4,1,How should I start troubleshooting this error?,"Reboot cooler. Press the GFCIs RESET button, unplug and re-plug the mains cord, then open the Service UI ? Reboot dialog."
2_4,2,Ive rebooted the cooler; what should I do next?,"If error code persists, confirm the SW version. If the SW version is incorrect, take a photo of the Service UI ""BasicInfo"" section and contact CV company.  a. After SW update, confirm in the Service UI ""BasicInfo"" section that the SW has been updated."
2_4,3,Ive confirmed the SW version and CV version; what should I do next?,Thank you for your patience. Please contact the QuikPick team. You will need a photo of the Service UI BasicInfo section and the Jupiter PCSN. Ensure you mention the error code to the team.
2_13,1,How should I start troubleshooting this error?,"Start by rebooting the cooler. Press the GFCIs RESET button, unplug and re-plug the mains cord, then open the Service UI ? Reboot dialog."
2_13,2,I've rebooted the cooler; what's next?,"Lock abnormal means the Jupiter senses the lock but its default state isnt as expected—often due to software control or physical blockage. Next, confirm the software version: open the Service UI and navigate to the BasicInfo section. Verify the SW version; if its incorrect, take a photo of the BasicInfo screen and contact the CV company to get the proper update. After updating, return to BasicInfo and ensure the new version is displayed before proceeding."
2_13,3,I've confirmed the software version is correct; what's next?,"Now test the lock and lock signal functionality to rule out mechanical blockage: physically open the door by pulling the handle. If the lock remains engaged, access the Service UI, tap Operation then Open Door. If the lock disengages on command, the lock mechanism and control signal are functioning properly."
2_13,4,I've verified the lock disengages via the Service UI; what's next?,"Inspect the lock cable assembly: power off the cooler and remove the control box cover. Using the electrical diagram on the cover and the PC sticker as guides, locate the cable labeled LOCK. Confirm the connector is fully seated on the Jupiter and tighten as needed. If the cable insulation or connector shows damage, replace the entire assembly before moving on."
2_13,5,I've ensured the lock cable is properly connected; what's next?,"Next, confirm the RFID pairing: open the FQC App and view the pairing between the reader and tag. If the reader and tag IDs match, the pairing is correct. If they differ, re-pair them per the CV companys procedure or contact CV support for assistance. Once re-paired, repeat the lock signal functionality test in the Service UI."
2_13,6,I've repaired the RFID and repeated the previous tests; what's next?,"Cycle through prevoius steps until each one passes. If all items PASS but the LOCK_ABNORMAL error still appears, the lock hardware itself may be faulty. At that point, replace the lock mechanism or escalate to your CV companys advanced support for deeper diagnostics."
